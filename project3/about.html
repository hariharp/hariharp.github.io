            <h3>Floats</h3>
            <p>This page utilizes CSS Floats to create a newspaper-like layout. Each section is floated to create a column effect, similar to how articles are organized in a newspaper.</p>

            <h3>Box Model</h3>
            <p>The CSS Box Model is used for the padding and margins around the text and image to ensure proper spacing and a clean layout.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>Media queries ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining readability on mobile and desktop devices.</p>
