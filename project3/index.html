            <p>For me, cooking is more than just preparing food; it’s an expression of art, a way to unwind, and a beautful expereince. Each recipe on this page has been tested many times, drawing from my own experiences and tastes. 
                From falvour filled salads full of freshness to filling main courses that are warming, these vegetarian dishes are designed to nourish our bodies.

            <p>Beyond just recipes, I want to share my passion for food education. Throughout this cookbook, you’ll find insights into cooking techniques, ingredient sourcing, and meal planning strategies 
                that I use. I believe that understanding the “why” behind cooking methods can elevate your skills and deepen your appreciation for each dish you prepare.

            <p>As you explore my collection of recipes, I encourage you to make them your own. Feel free to adapt each dish based on what you have on hand or your personal 
                preferences. Cooking is all about experimentation, so don’t hesitate to  with flavors and ingredients.

            <p>Food is a beautiful connector, a universal understanding that brings people together. Each time I prepare a meal, I’m reminded of the memories created around the table with friends and family.
                 My hope is that as you cook and share these recipes, you will create your own moments of joy and connection. Gather your loved ones, share stories, and relish the satisfaction of a meal crafted with care.

            <h2>CSS Concepts Used</h2>
            <h3>CSS Grid</h3>
            <p>The featured recipes are arranged using CSS Grid, which allows for a flexible layout that adjusts based on the screen size. The <code>.recipe-grid</code> class defines a grid layout that creates responsive columns for the recipe cards.</p>

            <h3>Box Model</h3>
            <p>The CSS Box Model is applied to each recipe card with margins, borders, padding, and content areas. Each <code>.recipe-card</code> has padding for internal spacing and borders to separate it visually from others.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>Media queries and responsive properties ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>
