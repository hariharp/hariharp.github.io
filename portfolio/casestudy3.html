        <h2>The Design Challenge</h2>
        <p>The World Culture Festival aimed to bring together diverse audiences to 
            celebrate global traditions through music, art, and cuisine. 
            Within this setting, the World Café needed to honor cultural 
            authenticity while creating an intuitive and welcoming experience 
            for attendees navigating a wide variety of food vendors, cuisines, 
            and languages. The design challenge lay in balancing authenticity 
            with unified branding making sure each cuisine felt distinct without 
            veering into appropriation; capturing festive energy while maintaining 
            functional clarity for wayfinding; and celebrating visual richness while 
            keeping systems scalable across formats and large crowds. The design 
            objective was clear: to create a visual identity that made every attendee 
            feel welcomed, every vendor feel elevated, and every meal feel like a 
            true cultural celebration.

        <h2>Understanding Visual Aesthetics</h2>
        <p >
            I conducted market research by studying well known international 
            food hubs such as Borough Market in London and Pike Place Market in Seattle. 
            I understood how food centered spaces celebrate cultural diversity 
            while maintaining coherence. I also explored the role of color psychology 
            in cross cultural communication to ensure the designs resonated with 
            a global audience all while keeping in mind the already decided branding of
            the larger event: The World Culture Festival. I landed on three main insights.

      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <blockquote>
      In my time working on this project, I learned that cultural humility is paramount in design.
      I discovered that inclusive representation demands dedicated research and collaboration, and I 
      found that universal design principles, like clear hierarchy and intuitive navigation, are the
      foundation for positive user experiences across diverse backgrounds. This experience also underscored
      the importance of systems thinking in visual design. I learned that creating flexible, comprehensive
      brand guidelines allows for individual expression like a vendor's unique personality, while maintaining
      a cohesive overall expereience. I also came to appreciate how small details, from typography
      to color relationships, can compound to elevate the entire design. Ultimately, this project 
      reinforced my beleif that great design must serve both functional and emotional purpose. I am
      glad I had this opportunity and will be able to apply these principles to future projects that 
      use thoughtful, inclusive visual experiences to unite individuals.
