        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>Despite Teradata's robust certification programs offering valuable 
            career credentials, university students faced significant barriers to
             participation. The existing system lacked student focused design,
              resulting in low awareness, poor completion rates, and missed opportunities
               for both students and Teradata's campus recruitment efforts.<br>
            <b>The core user problem:</b> Students wanted to advance their data 
            analytics skills and career prospects but found certification
             programs overwhelming, unclear, and lacking the community support
              needed for sustained motivation.</p>

           with 12 students at various certification stages, and stakeholder interviews
            at Teradata.

      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <blockquote>
       Reflecting on this project, I realized that peer led community building, transparent progress tracking,
       and clear career messaging are far more effective than tradition methods for reducing
       certification dropout rates. Looking back, I feel I should have integrated the program more 
       closely with university academic schedules and calendars while exploring more diverse partnerships
       to test its scalibility. This journey has taught me that community amplifies individual
       motivation and that transparency builds crucial trust with users. I learned that designing
       for a community requires a differernt perspective and approach than designing for individuals,
       and that sustainable engagement demands sytematic support. This project has deeply infomred my
       design practice, and I am excited to apply these community centered principles to my future
       initiatives that empower users through education, connection, and achievement.
