                    <p>Sunflower Bakery started with just one oven and a simple dream: to make the best baked goods in town. Over time, that small idea turned into something special, a place where every treat is made with care and a love for baking.</p>

                    <p>We expanded by building out a warm, inviting caf√©, turning Sunflower Bakery into more than just a place to grab a treat. It became a place where friends met for coffee, families share moments over pastries, and neighbors stop by to enjoy the comforting atmosphere of freshly baked goods and good company.</p>

                    <p>We took a big step forward by launching our online platforms‚ÄîInstagram, Facebook, Twitter, and of course, this very website! (Though, it didn‚Äôt always look this good!) Fun fact: if you check out the landing page, you‚Äôll find a number-guessing game inspired by Leo‚Äôs grandpa, who loved playing it with his grandsons. It‚Äôs a little piece of nostalgia we‚Äôre excited to share with you!</p>

                    <p>Our commitment to eco-friendly practices started with a simple question: how can we make a difference? It led us to partner with local farms, ensuring that our ingredients are fresh, seasonal, and responsibly sourced. We also made the switch to sustainable packaging, inspired by our founder‚Äôs childhood memories of visiting markets with reusable baskets. These changes reflect our belief that every small choice matters, and we‚Äôre proud to do our part for the planet while supporting our community.</p>
