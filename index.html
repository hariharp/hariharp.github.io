    <h1>How to Dress for North Carolina Weather!</h1>
<p>
    North Carolina weather can be particulary difficult to understand. Especially in the transition period of summer to fall.<br>
    Mornings tend to be a bit chilly and even cold, while as it reaches mid day it can be quite hot.<br>
    Lucky for you, here are some tips from a North Carolina native!
    <ul>
        <li>Layer, layer, layer!</li>
        <li>Chose versatile pieces that are breathable.</li>
        <li>Bring an umbrella or rain jacket!</li>
        <li>Accessorize smartly!</li>
        <li>Stay comfortable and functional.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>I hope those tips were helpful! But NC weather really isn't that bad, it's just a really good mix of everything!</p>
<p>
    <h3>Looking for good layering pieces?</h3><br>
    Look no further, here are some of my favorite things to keep on hand! 
    <ul>
        <li>A thin base layer that looks good on its own!</li>
        <li>A nice lightweight sweater, jacket, or cardigan.</li>
        <li>If it's really cold in the mornings and evenings keep a thicker jacket or cardigan on hand.</li>
    </ul>
    Even though these are just three pieces, it makes all the difference when trying to be comfortable in constantly<br>
    changing weather!

    <h3>Looking for the right footwear?</h3>
    If you are walking around a lot like me, here are some things to think about when choosing shoes!
    Things to look for:
    <ul>
        <li>Look for shoes with good <b>cushioning</b>, gel or memory foam are nice!</li>
        <li>Good <b>arch support</b> is important, this helps in preventing foot pain.</li>
        <li>Shoes made from <b>breathable</b> material can make all the difference.</li>
        <li>A <b>non-slip</b> sole can help prevent slips and even provide your with stability</li>
        <li><b>Flexible</b> shoes that move with your feet are great, not stiff ones.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
