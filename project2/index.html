    <!-- 
    Accessibility Features That I Implemented: 
    Semantic HTML:
       - Proper use of semantic HTML tags so that I could help assistive technologies navigate the page structure.
       - Use of <h1>, <h2>, and <p> to establish a clear hierarchy for screen readers.

    Text Alternatives for Images:
       - Every image is provided with  alt text.

    Keyboard Navigation:
       - All interactive elements such as links and buttons are keyboard accessible.
    Color Contrast:
       - Text color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA requirements. 
       - Neon green (#39FF14) on black (#000) is high contrast for users with low vision.

    Responsive Design:
       - A responsive viewport meta tag has been included so that the page is functional on different screen sizes.

    Hover and Focus States:
       - Interactive elements like links have visible hover to help users identify where they are on the page.

    Accessible Fonts:
       - A simple, font (‘Courier New’) is used to maintain clarity, with font sizes adjusted dynamically for readability.

    Meaningful Link Text:
       - Links have clear, descriptive text.

    Flexible Layout:
       - The page layout is designed to be flexible.

    Animations and User Comfort:
       - Animations such as "wiggle" effects are subtle, continuous, and non-intrusive.

    Focusable Elements:
       - Focus styles and outlines are preserved for interactive elements to support keyboard-only users.

    Footer Placement:
       - The footer is stuck to the bottom of the page using flexbox to ensure consistent positioning, especially when content is minimal, providing a clean and predictable user interface.
