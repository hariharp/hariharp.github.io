        <p>The news is disappointing—you didn’t get the offer. But as you look back, you realize that this experience was full of valuable lessons. Each interview teaches you something new, and with each rejection, you get one step closer to the right opportunity.</p>

        <p>It’s time to refocus, adjust, and move forward. There’s always another door waiting to be opened.</p>

        <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
