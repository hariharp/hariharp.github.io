        <p>You’ve received an offer. It feels like a win, and you feel a sense of accomplishment after that nerve-wracking interview!</p>

        <p>Now, with the offer in hand, you reflect on everything it took to get here: the preparation, the self-doubt, and the moments of clarity. This may be the end of one journey, but it’s just the start of a new one.</p>

        <p>With new challenges ahead, the only question left is: What will you make of this opportunity?</p>

        <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
